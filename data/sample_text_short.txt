Coastal Bermuda hay is associated with impactions in this most distal segment of the small intestine, although it is difficult to separate this risk factor from geographic location, since the southeastern United States has a higher prevalence of ileal impaction
and also has regional access to coastal Bermuda hay. Other causes can be obstruction by
ascarids (Parascaris equorum), usually occurring at 3â€“5 months of age right after deworming.
